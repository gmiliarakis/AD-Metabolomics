	abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common cause of dementia, accounting for more than 50 million patients worldwide. Current evidence suggests the exact mechanism behind this devastating disease to be of multifactorial origin, which seriously complicates the quest for an effective disease-modifying therapy, as well as impedes the search for strategic preventative measures. Of interest, preclinical studies point to serotonergic alterations, either induced via selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or serotonin receptor (ant)agonists, in mitigating AD brain neuropathology next to its clinical symptoms, the latter being supported by a handful of human intervention trials. Additionally, a substantial amount of preclinical trials highlight the potential of diet, fecal microbiota transplantations, as well as pre- and probiotics in modulating the brain's serotonergic neurotransmitter system, starting from the gut. Whether such interventions could truly prevent, reverse or slow down AD progression likewise, should be initially tested in preclinical studies with AD mouse models, including sufficient analytical measurements both in gut and brain. Thereafter, its potential therapeutic effect could be confirmed in rigorously randomized controlled trials in humans, preferentially across the Alzheimer's continuum, but especially from the prodromal up to the mild stages, where both high adherence to such therapies, as well as sufficient room for noticeable enhancement are feasible still. In the end, such studies might aid in the development of a comprehensive approach to tackle this complex multifactorial disease, since serotonin and its derivatives across the microbiota-gut-brain axis might serve as possible biomarkers of disease progression, next to forming a valuable target in AD drug development. In this narrative review, the available evidence concerning the orchestrating role of serotonin within the microbiota-gut-brain axis in the development of AD is summarized and discussed, and general considerations for future studies are highlighted.},

 abstract = {Function estimation/approximation is viewed from the perspective of numerical optimization in function space, rather than parameter space. A connection is made between stagewise additive expansions and steepest-descent minimization. A general gradient descent "boosting" paradigm is developed for additive expansions based on any fitting criterion. Specific algorithms are presented for least-squares, least absolute deviation, and Huber-M loss functions for regression, and multiclass logistic likelihood for classification. Special enhancements are derived for the particular case where the individual additive components are regression trees, and tools for interpreting such "TreeBoost" models are presented. Gradient boosting of regression trees produces competitive, highly robust, interpretable procedures for both regression and classification, especially appropriate for mining less than clean data. Connections between this approach and the boosting methods of Freund and Shapire and Friedman, Hastie and Tibshirani are discussed.},

Using the predictive and statistical models, computers can clean and curate the data, interpret and predict the outcomes of certainties (or uncertainties) with precise accuracy. Of course, the interpretation of the produced results and algorithmic solution designed for each problem needs to be fine-tuned and proficient for the target problem. Biomedical images relevant to different diseases are recorded from a body and are generally employed to diagnose precise physiological or pathological conditions. The objective of biomedical image analysis is exact modeling by using pattern recognition and computer vision to diagnose diseases by employing ML techniques. This chapter explains how artificial intelligence (AI) and ML techniques are utilized in disease diagnosis. An automated COVID-19 diagnosis approach based on deep feature extraction is also presented. After extracting features using deep transfer learning (DTL), the X-ray images are fed into the shallow ML model to diagnose COVID-19 from X-ray images. With chest X-ray, a patient can be identified as a potential COVID-19 patient and can be quarantined. X-ray equipment are already accessible in most hospitals, and already digitized. Since X-ray images are high dimensional data, a Convolutional Neural Network based feature extraction via transfer learning models are appropriate for the diagnosis of COVID-19. It may help an inpatient environment where the existing programs find it difficult to determine whether to keep the patient inward with other patients or separate them. This technique will also help classify patients with high COVID-19 risk who need to repeat testing with a false negative RT-PCR.}

TITLE = {Brain Kynurenine Pathway Metabolite Levels May Reflect Extent of Neuroinflammation in ALS, FTD and Early Onset AD},

ABSTRACT = {Objectives: Despite distinct clinical profiles, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) patients share a remarkable portion of pathological features, with a substantial percentage of patients displaying a mixed disease phenotype. Kynurenine metabolism seems to play a role in dementia-associated neuroinflammation and has been linked to both diseases. We aimed to explore dissimilarities in kynurenine pathway metabolites in these early onset neurodegenerative disorders in a brain-region-specific manner. Methods: Using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), kynurenine metabolite levels were determined in the brain samples of 98 healthy control subjects (n = 20) and patients with early onset Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease (EOAD) (n = 23), ALS (n = 20), FTD (n = 24) or a mixed FTD&ndash;ALS (n = 11) disease profile. Results: Overall, the kynurenine pathway metabolite levels were significantly lower in patients with ALS compared to FTD, EOAD and control subjects in the frontal cortex, substantia nigra, hippocampus and neostriatum. Anthranilic acid levels and kynurenine-to-tryptophan ratios were consistently lower in all investigated brain regions in ALS compared to the other diagnostic groups. Conclusions: These results suggest that the contribution of kynurenine metabolism in neuroinflammation is lower in ALS than in FTD or EOAD and may also be traced back to differences in the age of onset between these disorders. Further research is necessary to confirm the potential of the kynurenine system as a therapeutic target in these early onset neurodegenerative disorders.},

	abstract = {Alzheimer's is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting the central nervous system and cognitive processes, explicitly impairing detailed mental analysis. Throughout this condition, the affected individual's cognitive abilities to process and analyze information gradually deteriorate, resulting in mental decline. In recent years, there has been a notable increase in endeavors aimed at identifying Alzheimer's disease and addressing its progression. Research studies have demonstrated the significant involvement of genetic factors, stress, and nutrition in developing this condition. The utilization of computer-aided analysis models based on machine learning and artificial intelligence has the potential to significantly enhance the exploration of various neuroimaging methods and non-image biomarkers. This study conducts a comparative assessment of more than 80 publications that have been published since 2017. Alzheimer's disease detection is facilitated by utilizing fundamental machine learning architectures such as support vector machines, decision trees, and ensemble models. Furthermore, around 50 papers that utilized a specific architectural or design approach concerning Alzheimer's disease were examined. The body of literature under consideration has been categorized and elucidated through the utilization of data-related, methodology-related, and medical-fostering components to illustrate the underlying challenges. The conclusion section of our study encompasses a discussion of prospective avenues for further investigation and furnishes recommendations for future research activities on the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.},
